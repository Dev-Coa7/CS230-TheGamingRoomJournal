# Project Overview: The Gaming Room Client & Software Requirements
The Gaming Room had a unique software requirement for their game Draw It or Lose It. As a Technology Consultant, my primary task was to develop a web-based game that could operate seamlessly across multiple platforms. The client's vision was a game resembling the 1980s television game "Win, Lose or Draw." The game's core mechanic involves rendering images from a stock library as clues for teams to guess a phrase, title, or thing within a set time limit.
# Achievements
My strongest contribution was in the section of the design document where I made recomendations for operating platforms. I effectively balanced The Gaming Room's immediate needs with considerations for scalable future growth and cost-effective solutions.
# Design Document Process & Its Impact on Development
Working through the design document was instrumental in understanding the comprehensive requirements for developing a web-based application. It provided a clear roadmap and helped in systematically breaking down the project's complexities.
# Areas for Revision and Improvement
If revisiting a section of the work, I would refine the software design template, specifically the evaluation of server-side and client-side development, and the selection of development tools. A deeper and more focused analysis on how to develop our game for each platform, integrating a Java server and web front end, would enhance the document's utility.
# Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
Interpreting user needs, especially for a gaming company like The Gaming Room, was challenging yet crucial. The assumption was that the company had conducted a market study to identify entry points into the gaming market. This understanding guided the design process. Recognizing and addressing user needs is paramount. By understanding the customer's perspective, we can create a product that not only meets but exceeds their expectations. Offering cost-effective options, particularly for startups, is a key aspect of this understanding.
# Approach to Software Design
The approach involved thoroughly studying and understanding the problem, identifying specific features, and outlining at least one viable solution for each identified feature. This strategy required a detailed comprehension of the system architecture, particularly the interplay between client and server systems and their controlling subsystems. For similar future projects, a more profound grasp of the architectural design, especially regarding client-server interactions and subsystem controls, will be prioritized. This deeper understanding will enable more efficient and effective design solutions.
