Project Overview: The Gaming Room Client & Software Requirements
Client: The Gaming Room approached us with a unique software development need. As a Technology Consultant for them, my primary task was to develop a web-based game that could operate seamlessly across multiple platforms.
Software Requirement: The client's vision was a game inspired by their existing title, "Draw It or Lose It," resembling the 1980s television game "Win, Lose or Draw." The game's core mechanic involves rendering images from a stock library as clues for teams to guess a phrase, title, or thing within a set time limit.
Achievements in Documentation Development
Strengths: My strongest contribution was in the last section of the design document, particularly in personal recommendations. I effectively balanced The Gaming Room's immediate needs with considerations for scalable future growth and cost-effective solutions.
Design Document Process & Its Impact on Development
Process Benefits: Working through the design document was instrumental in understanding the comprehensive requirements for developing a web-based application. It provided a clear roadmap and helped in systematically breaking down the project's complexities.
Areas for Revision and Improvement
Revision Focus: If revisiting a section of the work, I would refine the software design template, specifically the evaluation of server-side and client-side development, and the selection of development tools. A deeper and more focused analysis on how to develop our game for each platform, integrating a Java server and web front end, would enhance the document's utility.
Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
Understanding User Needs: Interpreting user needs, especially for a gaming company like The Gaming Room, was challenging yet crucial. The assumption was that the company had conducted a market study to identify entry points into the gaming market. This understanding guided the design process.
Importance of User-Centric Design: Recognizing and addressing user needs is paramount. By understanding the customer's perspective, we can create a product that not only meets but exceeds their expectations. Offering cost-effective options, particularly for startups, is a key aspect of this understanding.
Approach to Software Design
Design Strategy: The approach involved thoroughly studying and understanding the problem, identifying specific features, and outlining at least one viable solution for each identified feature. This strategy required a detailed comprehension of the system architecture, particularly the interplay between client and server systems and their controlling subsystems.
Future Strategies: For similar future projects, a more profound grasp of the architectural design, especially regarding client-server interactions and subsystem controls, will be prioritized. This deeper understanding will enable more efficient and effective design solutions.
